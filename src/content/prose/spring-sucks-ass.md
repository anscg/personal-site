Amidst the library's hushed whispers, I gaze out the window at the supposedly cheerful spring day. They all say "with Spring comes hope", but all I see is a sneeze-inducing hellscape. The muddy fog, the f*ing exam, and the never stopping rain. 

Lovely birds screech their dawn chorus at ungodly hours. The sun, finnaly remembering it's job, blazes with the intensity of mister ####. Meanwhile, the weather, like that brainrot infused child, can't decide weather to flood my senses or burn me alive. As I sink deeper in my chair, I can't help but think: who tf decided to call this shi*show "Spring".

F* this shit.
